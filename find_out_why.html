		<h1>The Monty Hall Problem</h1>
			<p>This game was adapted from the Monty Hall Problem, a brain teaser in the form of a probability puzzle.
				<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem"><em>Wikipedia</em></a> :  The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser loosely based on the American television game show <strong>"Let's Make a Deal"</strong> and named after its original host, Monty Hall.  The problem is a paradox of the veridical type, because the correct result (that you should switch doors) is so counterintuitive it can seem absurd, but is nevertheless demonstrably true.  The Monty Hall problem is mathematically closely related to the earlier Three Prisoners problem and to the much older Bertrand's box paradox.</p>
						<p>The behavior of the host is key to the 2/3 solution:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>the host must always open a door that was not picked by the contestant</li>
								<li>the host must always open a door to reveal a shark and never the piglet</li>
								<li>the host must always offer the chance to switch between the originally chosen door and the remaining closed door</li>
